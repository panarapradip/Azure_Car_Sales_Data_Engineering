# Azure_Car_Sales_Data_Engineering
This project contains moving data from github to Azure SQL database and then load it in bronze layer incrementally under Azure Data Lake. Then load the data in silver layer in parquet format using Azure Databricks transformation steps. Prepare all the dimentsions tables and fact table in Azure Databricks to create star schema and finally load all the tables in Gold Layer in Azure Data Lake. Also implemented SCD Type 1 for all the dimensions which handles UPSERT operations. Then create databricks workflow to automate all the steps for further incremental load.
